# Previous Puredata Sqlite3 Externals

This folder contains previous pure-data sqlite3 externals by Michael McGonagle (see: http://puredata.info/Members/mjmogo). The latest and most developed version, `sqlite3db` was written iin 2009.

The projects have been modified to work with the overall's project's
compilation approach (static libs insteads of a huge amalgamated sqlite3 file,
Makefiles which use `pd-lib-builder`)
