Hi, I'm working on a minimal wrapper for sqlite3 (1 inlet, 1 outlet) which is supposed to support sql input via the messages to the inlet and results out of the outlet.

My flow is [sql msg] -> [fudiformat -u] -> [list tosymbol] -> [db external] 

So far, in my working prototype, I've managed to get messages like `select sqlite_version()` to work without issue. But as soon as I include commas in the message such as in `create table t ( id integer primary key, name text )` the message fails to parse completely.

I've tried escaping the comma with backslashes, and even with the [text] but still the same result.

The prior art on sqlite3 access (see: http://puredata.info/Members/mjmogo) is `SQLite3db` by Michael McGonagle written in 2009. I have



char str[80];
strcpy(str, "these ");
strcat(str, "strings ");
strcat(str, "are ");
strcat(str, "concatenated.");
